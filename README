Main view controller is relatively built out.  A few pieces of functionality:

1.  Grabs the report feed and mimics the web app's visualization of reports on a Google map.

2.  Gets user's ISP and shows it to them.  (using a third party service - Herdict location API is acting up, should discuss)

3.  Shows user the site summary for a URL they input.

Am building this with a nav controller based design - user will be able to tap green button to push another VC where they can test a URL and compose/submit a URL report of their own.
